## My Process

### Built With

- **Semantic HTML5 markup**
- **CSS custom properties**
- **Flexbox**
- **Mobile-first workflow**
- **Google Fonts**
- **Responsive design with media queries**

### What I Learned

While working on this project, I reinforced my understanding of responsive design and CSS Flexbox. Here are some key takeaways:

#### Responsive Design:

- Used a **mobile-first approach** and implemented a media query for larger screens (`min-width: 1440px`) to switch from a single-column layout to a two-column layout.

#### CSS Flexbox:

- Flexbox helped in centering the card and aligning elements within the container efficiently.

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: center;
}
```
